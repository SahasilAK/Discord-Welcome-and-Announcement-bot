# Discord-Welcome-and-Announcement-bot
Discord bot that welcomes new members , reply to various commands and send messages to announcement channel customized by user
I recommend repl.it to upload it since its easy
edit the .env files for your private datas
after you setup the bot use the link you recive after hosting to reach the bot page.
login with your username and password defined in .env
Fill the announcement data fields accordingly
after updating the data use the .malan command in discord message field or bot dm to sent the announcement.
